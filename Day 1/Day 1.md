Day 1

-Setting up Github

-Update Github profile information

-Creating a repository for module

-Choosing hypervisor, decided with Virtualbox

-Choosing of Linux distributions (Kali linux and Ubuntu)

-Using Virtual box for configuration, installation and setting up of the VM

-Trying out common commands like pwd, ls, cd, cat, touch, mkdir

-Using 'man' to read more into the common commands, the arguments available for use (am using verbose alot as it gives more infomration on most things)

Challenges:

-Unsure of how github works, didn't know that subfolders had to be manually created

-Many variations of Linux OS distributions, each variation has it's own flavors, each download have it's different versions (Lite, readily mounted/installed, .iso etc.)

-Allocation of resources, unsure of how much each VM needs, what service to be ran in future, how to reallocate (had to fully start from VM creation on virtualbox)
