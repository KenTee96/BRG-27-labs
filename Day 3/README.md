## Day 3

# Activities
- Looked at different DNS registrar services to find a domain
- Ended up deciding on using duckdns services where a subdomain under duckdns.org can be registered and used for free
- Set up of the duckdns domain
- Used dig to try out after the configuration
- After confirmation using dig, prepare to setup certbot
- Usage of certbot to ensure site is forced for https for secure connection

# # Challenges
- - Similarly, the variety of services avaiable is great
- - Coming up with a simple domain name (there are certain domain like .org .lab .ai etc that can be chosen for other regristrar other than duckdns, where these are available) to ensure that there are no confusion
- - Initially did not see https, only worked when i restarted the services and new connections are forced to be on https (still unsure of why)
