## Day 2

# Activities
- Took a look at Azure and AWS for cloud services (their costings etc)
- Decided on Microsoft Azure as I am dealing with Azure at work
- Choosing of VM type, took a look at the costings, used the costing also as an example of for the TCO practical application
- Configured network configurations, took the key .pem file to be on my local machine, tried to SSH using the key
- Did simple configurations like OS update
- CRON setup on the bash scripting, and tried around with the permissions for the script files (.sh)

# Challenges
- Had to learn some of the syntax again for the scripting, test script did not run some times and it was due to syntax errors, multiple edits had to be done
- While familiar with networking, the configuration of the VM albeit being straightforward, having the need to setup keypair, network and security groups was slightly overhwleming as it was the first time I have been doing that and there was alot of things to consider and look at
- Network configuration did not work at first, entered my private ip instead of my public ip (for my local machine)
